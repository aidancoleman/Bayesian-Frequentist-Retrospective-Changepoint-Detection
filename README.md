# Retrospective Changepoint Detection (Bayesian and Frequentist approaches)
Simulated data in R, with a structural break in mean and variance. Bayesian approach to detect single changepoint: Gibbs sampling is implemented to detect this changepoint and estimate model parameters.
Frequentist approach for multiple changepoints: fused LASSO signal approximator.
